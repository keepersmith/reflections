What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- If I lose power I might lose the changes.  Or I might forget to commit and mess things up.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Logically, some projects involve multiple files that work together.  Google Docs is not for programming projects, so treating each document separately makes more sense.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- With version control, it is easier to rollback bad changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- Mastering git.
